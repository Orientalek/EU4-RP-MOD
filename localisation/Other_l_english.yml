Thanks to his newly gained power, immense wealth and backing from a few influential families, throughout his entire life, he tried to unite Rhineland and Westphalia into a new "super territory" None of his campaigns succeeded and instead devastated his domain, especially Paderborn. Trying to gain new funds for another conflict, he wanted to merge Cologne and Paderborn into a single state, however, was unsuccessful due to the resistance of Paderborn's influential classes. With his death, a new Archbishop - Ruprecht of the Palatinate - was elected, however, due to familiar feuds and corruption, his appointment was not confirmed by neither Pope nor the Holy Roman Emperor for years, leading to Paderborn breaking out and electing Simon III as their new ruler."
