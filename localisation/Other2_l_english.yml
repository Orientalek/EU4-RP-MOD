In order to rebuild the capital, Sultan had to implement new country-wide taxes and bring dozens of thousands of workers from across the country.

When they returned with wheat, as it can feed the hungry, the widow ordered the wheat to be thrown into the harbour of Stavoren. When warned against this cruel behaviour and the fickleness of fate, she threw her ring and said that wheat being the greatest treasure, is as likely as her falling into poverty. Soon enough, at a banquet she finds the ring inside a fish served to her, and not much after, she loses all her wealth. In divine retribution, the port had silted, and the wheat now grew to become the sandbank. The story became widespread amongst our upper classes and brings its morals to the hearts of many more."

Sentenced to death, she was spared by the executioner and lived for six years with her son in a cave nourished by a roe. Siegfried found Golo's treachery and later, during a hunt was chasing the roe, suddenly discovering his wife's hiding place. The tale obtained wide popularity in "L'Innocence reconnue, ou vie de Sainte Genevieve de Brabant" by a French Jesuit, Rene de Cerisiers and quickly became a subject for dramatic representation in German art."
